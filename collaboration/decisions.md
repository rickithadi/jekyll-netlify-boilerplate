# üéØ JSMAW FINAL RECOMMENDATIONS FOR APPROVAL

## Executive Summary
The JSMAW team has conducted comprehensive analysis of your Jekyll site. While the design system is excellent (95% mature), there are critical technical debt issues and significant opportunities for content, SEO, and performance improvements.

- **Fix**: Install plugins and configure meta tags
- **Expected Result**: 40-60% improvement in search visibility

### 3. **Content Strategy Gap** (BUSINESS IMPACT)
