## CONTENT: 2025-08-20 15:45 - Site Content Analysis

### ‚úÖ **Content Strengths:**
- **Clear value proposition**: "Security-focused software engineer" is immediately communicated
- **Professional tone**: Technical expertise balanced with approachable language
- **About page structure**: Well-organized expertise grid makes skills scannable
- **Contact page clarity**: Direct, benefit-focused messaging

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Content Issues Identified:**

#### 1. **Front Matter Inconsistencies**
- `pages/blog.md` still references "Singapore" in meta description (should be "Melbourne")
- Missing `author` field in post front matter schema
- No standardized `excerpt` field across content

#### 2. **Content Gaps**
- **No blog posts exist** - site promotes "Read Security Insights" but no content
- **Missing case studies** - work examples link to contact, not detailed project pages
- **No testimonials** - credibility could be enhanced with client feedback

#### 3. **Information Architecture**
- **Work examples** could benefit from individual project pages
- **Service offerings** are scattered across about/contact - need dedicated services page
- **Blog categories** undefined - need content taxonomy

#### 4. **Content Optimization Opportunities**
- **Hero copy** could emphasize unique differentiators more strongly
- **About page** expertise descriptions could include specific technologies/frameworks
- **Call-to-action hierarchy** needs improvement - too many competing CTAs

### üìã **Recommended Actions:**
1. **Create sample blog posts** (3-5 technical articles)
2. **Add individual project pages** with case study format
3. **Standardize front matter** schema across all content
4. **Develop content taxonomy** for blog categories/tags
5. **Create dedicated services page** with clear pricing/packages
6. **Add testimonials section** to about or home page

### üéØ **Content Strategy Priority:**
**HIGH**: Blog content creation - site promises insights but delivers none
**MEDIUM**: Project case studies - current work examples lack depth
**LOW**: Front matter standardization - technical debt but not user-facing
