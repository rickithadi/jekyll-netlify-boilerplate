    - Check color consistency (black/white/gray + coral only)

## Design Philosophy Achieved:

- **Boring.industries inspired**: Ultra-minimal, typography-focused
- **Editorial sophistication**: Tight kerning, controlled spacing
- **Mobile-first responsive**: Progressive enhancement
- **Monochromatic palette**: Pure black/white/gray + coral accent
- **Typography hierarchy**: Consistent across all pages

## File Structure:
- Main styling: `_sass/partials/_design-system.scss`
- Layouts: `_layouts/home.html`, `_layouts/page.html`
- Components: `_includes/featured-work.html`, `_includes/recent-posts.html`
- Pages: `pages/about.md`, `pages/contact.md`, `pages/blog.md`

## DESIGNER FEEDBACK - August 20, 2025

### üéØ **Current State Assessment:**
The site has achieved solid foundational improvements but needs refinement for true boring.industries aesthetic:

**STRENGTHS:**
- Clean navigation with proper mobile hamburger functionality
- Good card-based layout structure for work examples
- Appropriate earth tone palette foundation
- Typography hierarchy is implemented consistently

**PRIORITY IMPROVEMENTS NEEDED:**

#### 1. **Typography Refinement** (HIGH PRIORITY)
- Current line-heights still feel loose - need more aggressive compression
- Letter-spacing could be tighter on headings (-0.05em to -0.06em range)
- H1 in hero needs more dramatic scale contrast
- Body text kerning needs fine-tuning

#### 2. **Section Spacing** (HIGH PRIORITY)
- Current 24px desktop spacing is good, but sections still feel spacious
- Consider reducing to 20px desktop, 16px mobile for ultra-tight feel
- Hero section has too much vertical padding
- Footer spacing could be more compressed

#### 3. **Visual Hierarchy** (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
- Hero intro paragraph needs more sophisticated styling
- Work cards could have tighter vertical rhythm
- Button styling feels slightly heavy for minimal aesthetic
- Post grid cards need refinement

#### 4. **Boring.industries Alignment** (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
- Need sharper contrast between content and whitespace
- Typography weight distribution could be more sophisticated
- Consider reducing overall visual "softness"

### ‚úÖ **IMPLEMENTED IMPROVEMENTS (August 20, 2025):**

1. **‚úÖ Reduced hero section padding by 25%** - Compressed from 2rem/3rem/4rem to 1.5rem/2.25rem/3rem
2. **‚úÖ Tightened H1 letter-spacing to -0.05em** - More dramatic scale contrast achieved
3. **‚úÖ Compressed section spacing to 20px desktop** - Reduced from 24px to 20px across all sections
4. **‚úÖ Refined button hover states for more sophistication** - Subtler shadows and transforms
5. **‚úÖ Adjusted work card typography for tighter feel** - Reduced line-heights and increased negative letter-spacing

## COMPREHENSIVE DESIGN QA REVIEW - August 20, 2025

### üîç **SITE-WIDE QA ASSESSMENT:**

**STRENGTHS IDENTIFIED:**
- ‚úÖ **Typography Hierarchy**: Consistent implementation across all pages with proper `-0.05em` H1 kerning
- ‚úÖ **Section Spacing**: Successfully compressed to `2rem` (20px) desktop spacing throughout
- ‚úÖ **Hero Section**: Proper 25% padding reduction implemented (`1.5rem/2.25rem/3rem`)
- ‚úÖ **Work Cards**: Clean list-based layout with effective hover states and year positioning
- ‚úÖ **Navigation**: Functional hamburger menu with proper backdrop blur effects
- ‚úÖ **Color Palette**: Successfully simplified to monochrome + coral accent (`$earth-coral`)
- ‚úÖ **Avatar Implementation**: Optimized 16rem mobile sizing for better text prominence

**CRITICAL ISSUES REQUIRING IMMEDIATE ATTENTION:**

#### 1. **Blog Page Layout Inconsistency** (HIGH PRIORITY)
- **Problem**: `_layouts/blog.html` uses outdated styling approach
- **Current State**: Hard-coded `margin-top: 10rem` and basic unstyled list
- **Required Fix**: 
  - Apply `container--narrow` for editorial consistency
  - Remove inline styles
  - Implement proper post grid styling
  - Add proper section spacing (`2rem` padding)
  - Apply stagger animations for consistency

#### 2. **Contact Page Form Integration** (HIGH PRIORITY)
- **Problem**: Contact form (`{% include contact-form.html %}`) styling unknown
- **Current State**: Form may not match minimal aesthetic
- **Required Fix**:
  - Verify form styling matches design system
  - Ensure proper spacing and typography alignment
  - Check button consistency with existing styles

#### 3. **SASS Deprecation Warnings** (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
- **Problem**: Multiple deprecation warnings for `@import` rules and `mixed-decls`
- **Impact**: Will break in future Dart Sass versions
- **Required Fix**: 
  - Migrate from `@import` to `@use` rules
  - Fix mixed declaration order in `_design-system.scss:540-558`

#### 4. **Typography Refinement Opportunities** (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
- **Hero Title**: Could benefit from even tighter letter-spacing (-0.06em)
- **Body Text**: Line-height could be compressed further (1.4 vs current 1.5)
- **Section Headers**: Consider reducing font-weight for more sophistication

#### 5. **Mobile Responsiveness Edge Cases** (LOW PRIORITY)
- **Work Cards**: Verify proper stacking on very small screens (<480px)
- **Hero Button Group**: Check spacing on mobile landscape orientation
- **Navigation**: Test touch targets meet accessibility standards (44px minimum)
