intro_paragraph: I'm a Full Stack Software Engineer with five years of
  experience building (and occasionally breaking) software. Iâ€™m passionate about
  clean, simple code and take a language-agnostic approach to solving problems.
  I see technology as both an enabler and a catalyst for change. I'm
  particularly interested in the intersection of security, technology, and
  society. Occasionally, I write about things.
