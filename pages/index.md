intro_paragraph: I'm a software engineer and cybersecurity enthusiast based in Melbourne who believes technology should be both powerful and human. When I'm not crafting secure systems or diving into code, you'll find me catching waves along the coast, working on my golf swing, or building playful projects like <a href="https://canhadi.surf" target="_blank">canhadi.surf</a>. I'm passionate about open source, digital privacy, and creating tech that actually makes life better.
