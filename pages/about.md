I am very passionate about Free Software. Being an active contributor to multiple FOSS projects I strongly believe in avoiding proprietary technologies where possible.I disagree with the current state of data privacy and reject the blatant mass collection of personal information. I also feel very strongly about Tech literacy for the masses and try to involve myself with mentoring and or teaching where I can as the state of tech literacy among the general public is abysmal.

I am also very interested in optimising athletic performance with technology, old thinkpads, minimal linux distros and mechanical keyboards. Oh digital and political freedoms as well.
