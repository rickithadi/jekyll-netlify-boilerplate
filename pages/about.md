intro_paragraph: Hi, I'm Hadi. I help teams build software that's both secure and scalable, with a focus on creating solutions that stand the test of time. Based in Melbourne, I work with organizations worldwide to craft systems that teams can trust and maintain. When I'm not collaborating on code, you'll find me catching waves along the coast, working on my golf swing, or building playful projects like [canhadi.surf](https://canhadi.surf).

    </div>

    <div class="about-content">
      <p>Currently pursuing a Master's in Cybersecurity, I specialize in creating robust, scalable systems with security built in from the ground up. I believe the best software comes from close collaboration - understanding not just what needs to be built, but how teams work, what constraints they face, and what success looks like for them.</p>

      <p>My approach combines technical rigor with clear communication. Whether I'm conducting security audits, architecting new systems, or mentoring team members, I focus on knowledge transfer and sustainable practices. With half a decade of experience across startups and enterprises, I've learned that the most elegant solutions are often the simplest ones that teams can confidently maintain and extend.</p>

          <h3>Open Source Advocate</h3>
          <p>I'm passionate about Free Software and open source principles. As an active contributor to multiple FOSS projects, I strongly believe in avoiding proprietary technologies where possible. I disagree with the current state of data privacy and reject the blatant mass collection of personal information.</p>

          <h3>Tech Education</h3>
          <p>Tech literacy for the masses is something I feel very strongly about - I try to involve myself with mentoring and teaching where I can. I believe technology should empower people, not control them, and that digital and political freedoms are fundamental rights worth defending.</p>
