<div class="markdown-content" markdown="1">

I write code in **JavaScript** and **Python**, mostly for web applications and am comfortable across the stack. Sometimes I help teams figure out why their applications *break*, or more importantly, how someone might **break them on purpose**.

**Secure software is not a given** — *penetration testing*, *code reviews*, helping teams understand what they're actually shipping. It's less glamorous than people think. Mostly it's reading documentation and trying things that **shouldn't work**.

When I'm not working, I surf, play mediocre golf and think deep.

<div class="markdown-content" markdown="1">

I choose tools based on what **solves the problem**, not what's *fashionable*. Most security issues come from teams rushing to ship without understanding what they're **actually building**.

Good security feels **invisible**. It's about building systems that *fail gracefully* and protect people's data without making everything painful to use. Privacy should be a **default**, not a *luxury feature*.

**Privacy is a human right**. Your data matters, and the *ethics* (and implementation) around how it's collected, stored, and used drive everything I do. The internet can be a dangerous place, and I believe deeply in building technology that **enhances rather than detracts** from human dignity.

<div class="markdown-content" markdown="1">

I work with teams who care about building technology that **doesn't exploit people**. If you need someone to review your security, find the problems *before your users do*, or just want a second opinion on your architecture, I'm happy to help.

Most projects involve some combination of *code review*, *penetration testing*, and *architecture discussion*. I prefer working with teams who want to understand **why** something is a problem, not just *how* to fix it.
