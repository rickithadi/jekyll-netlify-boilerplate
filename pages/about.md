## About Hadi Rickit

I am a Software Engineer and Cybersecurity Expert based in Melbourne, Australia, passionate about the art of software craftsmanship. My approach combines technical excellence with aesthetic design principles, believing that truly great software should be beautiful, secure, and built to last.

### Professional Focus

Currently pursuing a Master's in Cybersecurity, I specialize in creating robust, scalable systems while maintaining a strong focus on security. Through my consulting work with Gallifrey Consulting, I help organizations build secure, beautiful software solutions that stand the test of time. My expertise spans software engineering, security auditing, penetration testing, and system architecture.

### Philosophy & Values

I am very passionate about Free Software and open source principles. Being an active contributor to multiple FOSS projects, I strongly believe in avoiding proprietary technologies where possible. I disagree with the current state of data privacy and reject the blatant mass collection of personal information. I also feel very strongly about tech literacy for the masses and try to involve myself with mentoring and teaching where I can.

### Technical Approach

As a software engineer, I bring expertise in modern web technologies with an unwavering commitment to clean, maintainable code. My experience spans various programming languages and frameworks, always with a focus on delivering solutions that are robust, scalable, and aesthetically pleasing. I believe in the intersection of security, functionality, and design excellence.

### Beyond Code

I am also very interested in optimizing athletic performance with technology, old ThinkPads, minimal Linux distros, decentralized finance, golf and surfing. Digital and political freedoms are important values that guide both my work and personal philosophy.

When I'm not crafting software or conducting security assessments, you can find me contributing to open source projects, mentoring aspiring developers, or exploring the latest developments in cybersecurity and software engineering.
