intro_paragraph: Hi, I'm Hadi. When I'm not crafting secure systems or diving into code, you'll find me catching waves along Melbourne's coast, working on my golf swing, or building playful projects like [canhadi.surf](https://canhadi.surf). I believe technology should be both powerful and human - enabling meaningful solutions while remaining approachable and fun.

### Professional Focus

Currently pursuing a Master's in Cybersecurity, I specialize in creating robust, scalable systems with an unwavering focus on security. Through my consulting work, I help organizations build secure, beautiful software solutions that stand the test of time. My expertise spans software engineering, security auditing, penetration testing, and system architecture.

With half a decade of experience, I combine technical excellence with aesthetic design principles, believing that truly great software should be beautiful, secure, and built to last. My approach delivers solutions that are not only functional but also maintainable and scalable.

### Philosophy & Values

I'm passionate about Free Software and open source principles. As an active contributor to multiple FOSS projects, I strongly believe in avoiding proprietary technologies where possible. I disagree with the current state of data privacy and reject the blatant mass collection of personal information.

Tech literacy for the masses is something I feel very strongly about - I try to involve myself with mentoring and teaching where I can. I believe technology should empower people, not control them, and that digital and political freedoms are fundamental rights worth defending.

### Beyond Code

Life's too short to only talk about work! My satirical websites poke fun at tech culture and society, reminding me that technology should be approachable and fun, not just functional. There's something about both surfing and golf that mirrors good software engineering - patience, precision, and the constant pursuit of improvement.

My other interests include optimizing athletic performance with technology, collecting and restoring old ThinkPads, experimenting with minimal Linux distros, and exploring decentralized finance. When I'm not crafting software or conducting security assessments, you can find me contributing to open source projects, mentoring aspiring developers, or diving into the latest developments in cybersecurity and software engineering.
