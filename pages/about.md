      <h2>What I Actually Do</h2>
      <div class="text-base">
        <p class="mb-lg">I work on applications where security isn't an afterthought. This usually means diving into systems to understand how data flows, where it's vulnerable, and how to protect it without making everything impossible to use.</p>
        
        <p class="mb-lg">My focus areas are:</p>

      <h2>Outside of Work</h2>
      <div class="text-base">
        <p class="mb-lg">I'm probably drinking too much coffee, arguing about programming languages on the internet, or trying to convince my houseplants to stay alive. I also write occasionally about security things that annoy me enough to put into words.</p>
        
        <p>Melbourne's weather gives me plenty of excuses to stay inside and code, which works out well for everyone involved.</p>

        <p class="text-large">I'm always up for chatting about security, privacy, or that weird bug you can't figure out. Sometimes I take on projects, sometimes I just enjoy the conversation.</p>
