  Notion is a great tool for keeping track of stuff and organising your life.
  It's marketed as a productivity tool which it sort of is. I've been using it
  as of late for daily journaling. The functionality, aesthetics and
  extensibility have been very impressive. Below is an example of it can be
  used.

  A major drawback I've found is the lack of an officially supported way to deploy your site onto a custom domain. The closest feature available deploys your site with a .notionsite prefix which is not very pretty. Read on to find out how to get around this

# TLDR

1. Get a domain
2. Get a notion site
3. deploy notion site
4. link notion site to custom domain with cloudflare worker
5. add analytics with notionlytics

## Getting a Domain

There are many ways to do this. I would suggest going with a reputable domain provider, my preference and what I would recommend is to go through [namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/). They have decent customer service and a pretty simple UI. Just hop on, search for a domain you would like and purchase it

<p align="center">

</p>

Domain names can range from a few cents to thousands of dollars depending on popularity. It doesn't really matter where you get your domain from as long as you have access to the DNS settings so go with what you are familiar with



## Getting, deploying a Notion Site

Hop onto [notion](https://www.notion.so) and create an account. There are plenty of resources online on how to get set up with notion which i won't go through here. All that matters is your notion site is deployed or "shared to web" as notion terms it. Below is an example of how your's might look. Make sure the share to web toggle button is selected

## Link Notion site to Custom Domain

Now you have a notion site deployed at a domain generated by notion. This might look something like this

Not the prettiest huh, let's get that fixed. We'll do that by letting cloudflare handle DNS and with a[ cloudflare worker](https://workers.cloudflare.com/). 

### 1) Add your domain to Cloudflare

<p align="center">
<img alt="add your domain to cloudflare" title="add your domain to cloudflare" src="blob:https://rickithadi.com/01d2e6fe-8729-4c18-9036-32aac82adaa9" style="width:70%; height:20%">

</p>

Add your previously purchased domain to cloudflare and choose a free plan. 

### 2) Point your domain registrar's DNS to cloudflare

</p>

 Cloudflare should detect your registrar provide the necessary instructions. These are the steps if you use namecheap

4) Set up worker
