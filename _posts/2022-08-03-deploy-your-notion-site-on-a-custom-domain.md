  Notion is a great tool for keeping track of stuff and organising your life.
  It's marketed as a productivity tool which it sort of is. I've been using it
  as of late for daily journaling. The functionality, aesthetics and
  extensibility have been very impressive. Below is an example of it can be
  used.

  A major drawback I've found is the lack of an officially supported way to deploy your site onto a custom domain. The closest feature makes your site available at a .notionsite prefix which is not very pretty
